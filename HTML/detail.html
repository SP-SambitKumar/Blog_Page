        Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest
        of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997),followed
        by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai
        Maraikayar (5 November 1916 – 7 March 2021),[122]
        [123] Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed
        (d. 1995).[124] He was extremely close to his elder
        siblings and their extended families throughout his
        life, and would regularly send small sums of money to
        his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong
        bachelor.[124][125] Musical instrument veena enclosed
        in a glass casing Kalam's veena on display at the
        Rashtrapati Bhavan Museum in New Delhi Kalam was
        noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle.
        [125][126] He never owned a television, and was in
        the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7 a.m. and sleeping
        by 2 a.m.[127] His few personal possessions included
        his books, his veena, some articles of clothing,
        a CD player and a laptop; at his death, he left
        no will, and his possessions went to his eldest
        brother, who survived him
